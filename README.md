Implementation of Apriori Algortihm


Problem 3. Apriori algorithm. Implement the Apriori algorithm by first determining frequent itemsets and then proceeding to identify association rules. Consider that the input to your program is a sparse matrix where the rows are transactions and columns are items. Each value in your matrix is a binary variable from {0, 1} that indicates presence of an item in the transaction.

a) Implement both Fk−1 × F1 and Fk−1 × Fk−1 methods. Allow in your code to track the number of generated candidate itemsets as well as the total number of frequent itemsets.
b) Use three data sets from the UCI Machine learning repository to test your algorithms. The data sets should contain at least 1000 examples, and at least one data set should contain 10,000 examples or more. You can convert any classification or regression data set into a set of transactions and you are allowed to discretize all numerical features into two or more categorical features. Compare
these two candidate generation methods on each of the three data sets for three different meaningful levels of the minimum support threshold (the thresholds should allow you to properly compare different methods and make useful conclusions). Provide the numbers of candidate itemsets considered in a table and discuss the observed savings that one of these methods achieves.
c) Enumerate the number of frequent closed itemsets as well as maximal frequent itemsets on each of your data sets for each of the minimum support thresholds from the previous question. Compare those numbers with the numbers of frequent itemsets.
d) Implement confidence-based pruning to enumerate all association rules for a given set of frequent itemsets. Use the previous data sets, with three levels of support and three levels of confidence to quantify the savings in the number of generated confident rules compared to the brute-force method.
e) For each data set and each minimum support threshold, select three confidence levels for which you will generate association rules. Identify top 10 association rules for each combination of support and confidence thresholds and discuss them (i.e. comment on their quality or peculiarity). Select data sets where you can more easily provide meaningful comments regarding the validity of rules.
f) Instead of confidence, use lift as your measure of rule interestingness. Identify top 10 rules for each of the previous situations and discuss the relationship between confidence and lift. 

N.B. : No specialized libraries are allowed for this task. Make sure that you code runs and submit all the code you used in this task, including the code that converts data sets from UCI Machine Learning repository into a transaction data set. Do not include raw data sets in your supplement; however, do provide links to the data sets you used such that your code can be run independently and its performance can be verified.
